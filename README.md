# finite_state_lab
Exploring finite state machines through a "Choose your own adventure" game about going through a school day as a music student.

## Technical Frawework
I used the open-source Twine model to create my state project.

## Running the Project
To run the project, either download the html or twee file to your computer. If downloading the html file, simply open the file in a web browser. Alternatively, download the twee file and import it into Twine to run it.
